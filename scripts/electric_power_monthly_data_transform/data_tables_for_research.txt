Summary of Recommended Tables
Primary Generation Overview: 1.1, 1.1.A, 1.2.A, 1.2.B, 1.2.C, 1.2.D
Regional and Sector-Specific Generation: 1.3.A, 1.3.B, 1.4.A, 1.4.B, 
1.5.A, 1.5.B, 1.6.A, 1.6.B, 1.7.A, 1.7.B, 1.8.A, 1.8.B
Renewables and Hydro Power: 1.10.A, 1.10.B, 1.11.A, 1.11.B
Solar and Biomass by Census Division: 1.17.A, 1.17.B, 1.18.A, 1.18.B


Summary of Recommended Tables
Average Price by Sector: 5.3
Sales by Sector and State: 5.4.A, 5.4.B
Revenue by Sector and State: 5.5.A, 5.5.B
State-Level Average Price by Sector: 5.6.A, 5.6.B
These tables collectively offer a comprehensive view of how 
electricity prices, sales, and revenue vary by sector and state. 
By understanding these factors, the model can better predict 
demand changes in response to pricing and revenue shifts, which 
are often driven by seasonal and weather-related factors.

Summary of Recommended Tables
Net Summer Capacity by Technology and Fuel Type: 6.2.A, 6.2.B, 6.2.C
Capacity Factors: 6.7.A, 6.7.B, 6.7.C
Capacity Changes: 6.1
These tables will offer insights into how generation capacity aligns 
with demand, particularly during high-demand summer months, and how 
capacity utilization differs by fuel type. This data is essential 
for building a model that considers how available capacity can support
energy needs under seasonal and climatic variations.
